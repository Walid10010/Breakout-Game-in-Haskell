# Breakout-Game-in-Haskell

A **networked Breakout clone** implemented entirely in **Haskell**, featuring:

-  **GTK-based GUI** for the game interface  
-  **MVar concurrency** for safe shared-state updates  
-  **UDP & TCP communication** for multiplayer and real-time sync  
-  Purely functional game logic separated from IO  
-  Modular Cabal structure for clean builds and testing
